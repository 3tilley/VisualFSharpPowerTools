Depth Colorizer
----------------

This feature, originally written by Brian McNamara, highlights the indentation in code using color.

For instance this code with the colorizer turned on

![Not colorized](img/notcolorized.png)

would look like this

![Colorized](img/colorized.png)

A default set of colors can be used, as in the examples above, or custom colors can be added to the registry as documented [here](http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/f-source-code-structural-colorizer-available/)
